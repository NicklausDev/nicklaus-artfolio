                        <h3>Vibrant Feminity</h3>
                        <p>This commission was to take the submitted selfie and transform it into a picture that showcased "I am female and I will be be energitcly bold". Thus the employ of vibrant splashes of color.</p>

                        <h3>Purple Hearts</h3>
                        <p>This was undoubtedly my best pencil, graphite potrait. It may not look like it but these were two different photos from the couple's best moments drawn into one. Beautiful, it spots a subtle purple overlay since  that is their favorite color.</p>

                        <h3>Eternal Love</h3>
                        <p>This potrait represents so much in the sense that there's a lot of ways to view the world, the most beautiful approach being it's built for two, sharing each other's love, forever... plus it was my first ever digital potrait commission.</p>

                        <p>In the "Ascend" comic was a character that started as a trusting, hopeful, somewhat gullible person, but as the story progressed, she hated that version of herself believing it made her weak, but couldn't let go as it was just who she was.</p>

                        <p>Final two are dear to me as the white n black one was the result of a 7-month training to improve my art style and the next was my first comic illustration using industry level software.</p>
